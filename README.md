# NRF51 Radio Simulator

This repository can be used to simulate the nrf51 radio hardware for creating new protocols; written in Typescript; executed by Node.

## Motivation

Developing new protocols that are timing critical is very difficult, debugging mechanisms are therefore required. Using serial, or GDB debugging modifies the time domain, and therefore the protocol, making diagnosis of bugs difficult.
